# ICC_Test_Match

Test cricket is the form of the sport of cricket with the longest match duration and is considered the 
game's highest standard. Test matches are played between national representative teams that have 
been granted ‘Test status’, as determined and conferred by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The 
term Test stems from the fact that the long, gruelling matches are mentally and physically testing. Two 
teams of 11 players each play a four-innings match, which may last up to five days (or longer in some 
historical cases). It is generally considered the most complete examination of a team's endurance and 
ability. 
The Data consists of runs scored by the batsmen from 1877 to 2019 December.
